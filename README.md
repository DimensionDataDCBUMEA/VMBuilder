# VMBuilder

The VMBuilder project was established to provide Powershell based automation to anyone wanting to deploy bulk Virtual Machines on the Dimension Data CaaS Platform.

The tool has been specifically written to take Excel as the input format with a number of columns available to be populated.
It will allow for servers to be built in multiple nodes, network domains and even VLANs.

All server templates are available to be provisioned.

Please take careful note to make sure that you amend the filename, username and password fields appropriately - otherwise the script will not execute.
